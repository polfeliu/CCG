# CCG. 

CCG is a C/C++ code generation framework for python. It encapsulates the language syntax and grammar with python objects to be able to manipulate them more easily and generate code automatically, with a configurable style.

This library will be the developer's friend for code generation applications. It can be the language abstraction layer for any code generation project for C/C++. It won't do anything that couldn't be done manipulating strings but the code written with it will be easier to write and understand and the style of the generated code won't be embedded in the application, leaving the option to the developer to pass all the style choices to the end user without any effort.
